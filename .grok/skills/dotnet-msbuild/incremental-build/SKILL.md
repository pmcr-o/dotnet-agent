name: incremental-build
description: "Guide for optimizing MSBuild incremental builds. USE FOR: builds slower than expected on subsequent runs, 'nothing changed but it rebuilds anyway', diagnosing why targets re-execute unnecessarily, fixing broken no-op builds. Covers 8 common causes: missing Inputs/Outputs on custom targets, volatile properties in output paths (timestamps/GUIDs), file writes outside tracked Outputs, missing FileWrites registration, glob changes, Visual Studio Fast Up-to-Date Check (FUTDC) issues. Key diagnostic: look for 'Building target completely' vs 'Skipping target' in binlog. DO NOT USE FOR: first-time build slowness (use build-perf-baseline), parallelism issues (use build-parallelism), evaluation-phase slowness (use eval-performance), non-MSBuild build systems."

# incremental-build

This is a PMCR-O integration wrapper over the pinned `dotnet/skills` repository.
The upstream source remains immutable at `.pmcro/upstream/dotnet-skills/plugins/dotnet-msbuild/skills/incremental-build`.

## Workflow
1. Route only after `.agents/catalog.json` selects plugin `dotnet-msbuild` and skill `incremental-build`.
2. Read `references/upstream.md`, then the upstream source on demand.
3. Use `scripts/integrate.ps1` for both agent execution and manual terminal execution.
4. Integration is dry-run by default. `-Apply` is explicit and never widens the current grant.
5. Return exact source path, command, exit code, and evidence to the PMCR-O checker.
