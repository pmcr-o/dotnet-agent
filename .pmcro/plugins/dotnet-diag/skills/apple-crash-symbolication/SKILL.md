name: apple-crash-symbolication
description: "Symbolicate .NET runtime frames in Apple platform .ips crash logs (iOS, tvOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS). Extracts UUIDs and addresses from the native backtrace, locates dSYM debug symbols, and runs atos to produce function names with source file and line numbers. Automatically downloads .dwarf symbols from the Microsoft symbol server using Mach-O UUIDs. USE FOR triaging a .NET MAUI or Mono app crash from an .ips file on any Apple platform, resolving native backtrace frames in libcoreclr or libmonosgen-2.0 to .NET runtime source code, retrieving .ips crash logs from a connected iOS device or iPhone, or investigating EXC_CRASH, EXC_BAD_ACCESS, SIGABRT, or SIGSEGV originating from the .NET runtime. DO NOT USE FOR pure Swift/Objective-C crashes with no .NET components, or Android tombstone files. INVOKES Symbolicate-Crash.ps1 script, atos, dwarfdump, idevicecrashreport."

# apple-crash-symbolication

This is a PMCR-O integration wrapper over the pinned `dotnet/skills` repository.
The upstream source remains immutable at `.pmcro/upstream/dotnet-skills/plugins/dotnet-diag/skills/apple-crash-symbolication`.

## Workflow
1. Route only after `.agents/catalog.json` selects plugin `dotnet-diag` and skill `apple-crash-symbolication`.
2. Read `references/upstream.md`, then the upstream source on demand.
3. Use `scripts/integrate.ps1` for both agent execution and manual terminal execution.
4. Integration is dry-run by default. `-Apply` is explicit and never widens the current grant.
5. Return exact source path, command, exit code, and evidence to the PMCR-O checker.
